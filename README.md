# ProjetosRockeseat-Stage03-JardimToupeiras

The proposal of the Stage 03 project is to create animations of moles coming out of holes in a garden using @keyframe.

This animation was made only with HTML and CSS. @keyframe, animation property, position, display flex and z-index were used.

In order for the moles to appear on the screen more than once, it will be necessary to refresh the page.
